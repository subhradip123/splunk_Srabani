The server which will act as deployment server, have to run this command
# $Splunk_home/bin/splunk enable deploy-server

Deployment clients:
# $Splunk_home/bin/splunk set deploy-pool <ip of ds>:8089
Eg. https://172.31.34.18:8089
The settings are saved in #splunk_home/etc/system/local/deploymentcliet.conf

To check all cllients:
Now we can log into gui of ds->settings->forwarder management
Note: We need to add atleast one deployement app to make all cliens visible in forwarder management.

Deployment apps:
# $Splunk_home/etc/deployment_apps
All the apps we want to deploy will stay here.
App directory structure:
<app_name>/local/.conf files
Eg.
mkdir ufapp
cd ufapp
mkdir local
cd local
vi inputs.conf
[monitor:///var/log/secure]
index=main
sourcetype=securelog

Server-class:
vi $Splunk_home/etc/system/local/serverclass.conf
[serverClass:<serverclass_name>]
whitelist.0=192.128.42.10
whitelist.0=192.168.56.*
blacklist.0=192.168.56.13
blacklist.0=192.168.56.19

[serverClass:<serverclass_name>:app:<app_name>]
restartSplunkd = 1
reatartSplunkWeb = 0

push app:
# $Splunk_home/bin/splunk reload deploy-server
