field extraction:
There are two types of field extraction based on when we are extracting it.

1. Indextime field extraction:
If we extract fields before data get stored, then it is called indextime field extraction.
It done from HF, IDX.


2. Searchtime field extraction:It is done after data get stored.
It is done on IDX, SH.
